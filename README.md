# Maquetació I

![Maquetació I](/nivell-4-bonus/images/screenshot.png)

Redesign, layout and microinteractions in a simple blog site. Simply markup and CSS. I've sprinkled some JS and used [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/) for smooth/momentum scrolling.

## Structure

As the first assignment of [IT Academy](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/es/itacademy), this consists in building the HTML and CSS from a given mockup.

There's a folder for each one of the levels and a commit for each exercise.
I've added a Bonus folder where I've

- Redesigned the site respecting its original sections.

- Redesigned the sidebar so that it acts as a filter by date (I've added some interactivity but not the filtering).

- Added Lenis for momentum scrolling.
